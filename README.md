# TodoIt-Server

This is the server side code for my TodoIt app
A lot needs to happen here.

Under the hood, this is a basic express app.
Going to rewrite as much of it as I can with TS

### the current state of TodoIt
I will be rewriting TodoIt's server side in an effort to make things cleaner and easier to README.md
the current code base was written as quickly as possible to see what I could learn. Now that I've done
a bit of learning and have some ideas of things I'd like to see a version 2 will be written.

I'd like it to be easier to read for the most part and have better app archictectur over all
